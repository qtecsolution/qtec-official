				  Qtec Solution Limited follows some phases while developing

				  first phase. In this phase, we first analyze the target
				  market. We do research on the market as our developers need
				  to identify what type of features and services the software
				  must provide so that customers get the best out of it. Then
				  we analyze the requirements of the project. We create a
				  detailed outline of the task of the developers, design, the
				  timeline within which the project will be completed, and
				  other necessary components.

				  After the project analysis and definition is done

				  project specifications and requirements. Developers at Qtec
				  Solution Limited follow proper guidelines and procedures
				  while developing. The front-end developers work on building
				  the project interfaces and client-side applications.
				  Back-end developers work on creating core backbone
				  applications with API and databases. The senior managers and
				  programmers review the codebase and check for edge cases.
				  Where a staging version of the project is implemented on the
				  project to check whether all the requirements are matched or
				  not. The Client also tests it. Qtec Solution team also
				  maintains the time schedule very carefully. After coding is
				  done, the project goes through implementation. Where a pilot
				  test is implemented on the project to check whether all the

			  <div id="scrollspyTesting" class="descriptions">
				<h5 class="title">Performance Testing</h5>
				<p class="text">
				  After development comes the performance testing of the
				  project. In the performance testing phase, we check whether
				  there are any bugs or errors in the software. We verify the
				  software’s functions and check requirements according to
				  analysis with expert testers before delivering it to the
				  users. If there is any defect in the code, the tester
				  notifies the developers. Developers then check and if the
				  defect is valid they start working on improving the flaws.
				  This process is repeated until the software becomes bug-free
				  and meets the actual requirements.

				  After all the necessary testing we deliver the project to

				  different types of issues can arise. To solve those issues
				  we keep a maintenance team. The team work on the the after
				  service issues of the software. The maintenance team keeps
				  an eye on the software for any kind of bugs or errors. If
				  clients find any issues they notify the maintenance team.
				  The team then checks on the issue and if it's valid they
				  work on the issue until it's fixed. Qtec Solution
				  maintenance team keeps clear communication with clients so
				  it gets easier to fix any issues regarding software.
